Exercise: R1, R2, R12, R23


### R1. What is the difference between a host and an end system? List several different types of end systems. Is a Web server an end system?

The meaning of host and end system has no difference. The things that are connected to the Internet, they are all end system which is also called host. Therefore, Web Server also can be an end system.

The word rptocol means that well established and time honoured rules have made it eaiser for nations and people to live work together 

### R12. What advantage does a circuit-switched network have over a packet-switched network? What advantages does TDM have over FDM in a circuit-switched network?

A circuit switch network can guarantee a certain amount of end to end bandwidth (which is also called dedicated connection) 

FDM requires sohpiscated analog hardward to shift signal into appropriate frequency bandwidth 

### R23. What are the five layers in the Internet protocol stack? What are the principal responsibilities of each of these layers?


```
================================
|     Application Layer        |   - Provides Service / Protocols to application + data formatting + control session (Data)
================================
|     Transport Layer          |   - Fragmentation / Sequencing Data, Error Recovery, Flow control (Segments)
================================
|       Network Layer          |   - End to End delivery + Logical Addressing  (Packets / Datagrams)
================================
|      Link  Layer             |   - Physical Addressing + Error Detection + ACK (Frames)
================================
|      Physical Layer          |   - Network Topology  (Bits)
================================
